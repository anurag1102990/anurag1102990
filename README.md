🎓 **Computing Science undergraduate** at the **University of Alberta**, focus on **Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning**.  
💡 I love building practical AI systems — tools, research, and products.  

## 🧠 What I Do  

- **Machine Learning & AI Research:**  
  Reinforcement learning, generative models, and data-driven systems.  
  Currently researching policy optimization for imperfect-information games.  

- **Full-Stack & Product Development:**  
  Experienced with front-end, back-end, and cloud pipelines — I enjoy taking ideas from concept to deployment.  

- **Freelance / Collaboration Work:**  
  Open to ML-based app development, model integration, or full-stack projects involving AI features.  

## 🚀 Featured Project  

### 🧩 [CodeNeuron](https://codeneuron.tech) — Hands-on AI/ML Practice Platform  
Built a platform to make AI/ML learning more intuitive and project-oriented.  

- Datasets and structured, story-driven problems to build intuition — not just code  
- Browser-based IDE with sandboxed execution and instant visual feedback  
- Streak tracking, discussion space, and personal notes for community learning  

## 💻 Previous Experience  

- **AI/ML Researcher @ University of Alberta** – Reinforcement learning & game-AI research (policy gradient optimization).  
- **ML Intern @ PCL Construction** – Built predictive BIM models (98%+ accuracy).  
- **Software Developer Intern @ PaySpaze** – Developed and deployed Flutter apps with secure digital authentication.  

## ⚙️ Tech Stack  

**Languages:** Python, TypeScript, C++, JavaScript, Dart  
**Frameworks & Tools:** React, Next.js, PyTorch, TensorFlow, Firebase, Docker, GCP
